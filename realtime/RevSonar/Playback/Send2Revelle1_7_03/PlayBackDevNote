 01/04/02: get the file name from user and chop the date of the file name, create the output file name with concated date. 
Ex: data[01/04/2002] -> create output filename: matfile[01/04/2002]

 01/05/02: use pointer to implement createOutFilename routine 

 01/07/02: copy from the above version, clean the code before testing on Sun Unix machine
 --> works on scgproc

 01/08/02: copy from the above version, change name to a short one: pb1_8.c create mat file 
 01/09/02: copy from the above version, change name to a short one: pb.c
	     write Makefile for compile
	     add all linked files
	- change all the codes base on Revelle structure
	- use Project Builder instead of Unix editor.
--> can read header and file name, get the file size, write the header and file name into out put file

 01/10/02: copy from 1/9/02 version:
	- read data
	- write these data into the out put file
	- write the file name at the end of the out put file
	- get option from the user, to create the out put file name (aux, cov, vel, .... )

 01/14/02:
- We do not need to rewrite the header information at the end of the process. This task only need if we allow the user interrupt while application running.  If we allow it, we need to create the seperated var rec_num for cov and covn.

01/15/02:
   Compile and run this application on Unix. 
	- make file
	- run on Unix

01/17/02:
copy from MacOSUnix/ sources, change Makefile (-xCC for reading C++ comments and -lm for math.h)
---> can compile and run on Sun (from David's system)

1/18/02:
this version is cleaned, compiled on Sun(David's system), and sent to Revelle

1/22/02:
copy from 1/18 version, compile on MacOSX(Unix).  Test with data from Revelle

1/7/03:
Copy from "Last Version". 
Test with data Revelle 2001, send to Revelle (for Janet).

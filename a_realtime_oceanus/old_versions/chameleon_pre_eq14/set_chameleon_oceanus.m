% set_chameleon_oceanus.m
%
% This gets called by almost every other function to determine paths, etc. 
% Input the paths of the raw data (which has already been copied by 
% backup_chameleon_timer.m). Input the processed path. Also input: 
% cruise_id, year, maximum depth, and start file number. Pre-set the 
% parameters to plot, their units, and their color limits. 
%
% Functions that call set_chameleon_oceanus:
%   - backup_chameleon_timer_oceanus
%   - make_chameleon_timer_oceanus
%   - show_chameleon_timer_oceanus

% process_file_oceanus.m
%
% Originally, this was written as process_file_oceanus, but that version
% had some grave errors, especially with the way the raw files were being
% written on YQ14 (and onward). It made most sense for me to rewrite it
% from scratch.
%
% This file looks to see what raw files exist. Then it looks to see which
% files have been processed. It then processes the raw files that have not yet
% been processed and adds them to the last position in the summary file.
%
% Unfortunately, it still has to create some weird variables like q.series
% and q.script.num, which are used deep within the functions. Also, most of the
% processing functions are from ages ago (and would benefit from a thorough
% rewrite.) These are: cali_realtime, average_data, calc_dynamic_z. For the
% YQ14 cruise, raw_load_cham2 was written. I rewrote a bit of
% add_to_sum_oceanus, but it is essentially the same as in previous
% versions of the code.
